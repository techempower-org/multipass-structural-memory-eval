"""Category 5: Gap Detection — The Missing Room.

Produces a diagnostic reading of structural gaps in a memory system's
graph. External (L3) detection only — uses the topology layer; does
not ask the system to surface its own gaps (that would be L1/L2 and
is adapter-driven).

Signals reported:

  - Components, isolated-node count, structural bridges (L3a): crude
    "these parts of the graph aren't connected at all" reading.
  - Betti-1 persistence on the largest component (L3b): loops that
    survive the Vietoris-Rips filtration are stable structural holes
    inside an otherwise connected region.
  - Candidate gaps (L3c): pairs of components that share an
    entity_type — i.e., they hold the same kind of thing but are
    structurally disconnected. This is a heuristic; a maintainer
    decides whether the missing edge is a real gap or expected.

When called with ``seeded_missing_edges`` (from a fixture or a
hand-curated ground-truth file), the scorer also reports gap recall
and precision against that truth.

The spec defines gap recall as "fraction of seeded gaps the system
identifies." For external detection here, a seeded edge (u, v) is
considered recalled when u and v end up in different components and
the (component_u, component_v) pair is reported as a candidate gap.
