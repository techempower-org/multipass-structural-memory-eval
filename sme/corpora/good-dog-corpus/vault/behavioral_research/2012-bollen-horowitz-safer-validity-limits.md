# Bollen & Horowitz 2012 — SAFER Validity and the Assessment Prediction Problem

## Summary

In **2012**, Kelly Bollen and Jason Horowitz published a masked controlled study in *Applied Animal Behaviour Science* (141:139-148) evaluating whether two shelter behavior assessment instruments — the ASPCA's **SAFER** (Safety Assessment for Evaluating Rehoming) and a modified **Assess-A-Pet (mAAP)** — could correctly identify dogs with and without a history of aggression, as measured by the validated **C-BARQ** questionnaire. SAFER showed **sensitivity of 0.60 and specificity of 0.50** for binary aggression classification — performance well below the threshold for a screening tool used to make adoption and euthanasia decisions. The study concluded that behavior assessment results should be used in conjunction with intake history and staff observations, not as the sole determinant of a dog's fate.

## What the source reported

The study recruited 67 dogs whose owners had completed the C-BARQ, a validated behavioral history questionnaire. Dogs were categorized into low/no aggression and moderate-to-severe aggression groups based on C-BARQ scores. Both SAFER and mAAP were administered by assistants **masked to the dogs' behavioral histories** — a methodological strength.

For the binary classification (aggression vs. no aggression), SAFER results:

- **Sensitivity: 0.60** (95% CL = 0.44, 0.74) — the probability of correctly identifying an aggressive dog
- **Specificity: 0.50** (95% CL = 0.28, 0.72) — the probability of correctly identifying a non-aggressive dog
- **Odds ratio: 1.5** — an aggressive dog was only 1.5 times more likely to be classified as aggressive by SAFER

By contrast, mAAP achieved sensitivity of 0.73 and an odds ratio of 4.1 (95% CI 1.4, 11.7), performing significantly better at classifying aggressive dogs despite also having moderate limitations.

When SAFER subtest scores were split into multiple aggression categories (fear/inhibited aggression vs. moderate aggression vs. severe aggression), SAFER results were **no longer significantly correlated** with the historical aggression categories — a finding that the authors flagged as particularly concerning given that shelter decisions often depend on fine-grained behavioral distinctions.

The authors recommended that assessment results be used **in conjunction with** intake history and staff observations rather than as a standalone decision tool.

## Why this fits the corpus

This note introduces a new conceptual domain — **applied shelter behavior assessment** — distinct from the training methodology thread (Schenkel → Mech → AVSAB → Vieira de Castro). It seeds a contradiction at the empirical level: the standardized tool ASPCA developed and promotes for widespread shelter use (SAFER) cannot reliably distinguish aggressive from non-aggressive dogs in a controlled study.

- **Cat 3 (contradiction).** The `contradicts` edge from `pub_bollen_horowitz_2012_safer_validity` to `concept_behavior_assessment_limitations` is bound at the instrument-validation level. Bollen & Horowitz 2012 directly measured whether SAFER predicts what shelters need it to predict, and found it does so at near-chance levels.
- **Cat 2c (multi-hop).** The `authored_by → affiliated_with` chain would be testable if Bollen/Horowitz institutional affiliations were directly verified (not available from search summaries). Co-author Jason Horowitz is a known animal behavior researcher; institutional affiliation was not confirmed at fetch time.
- **Cat 4g (phantom edge).** The `contradicts` edge between the SAFER validity study and the ASPCA organizational endorsement of SAFER is flagged `needs_grounding: false` here because the contradiction is empirically demonstrated (sensitivity/specificity numbers vs. the ASPCA's promoted use of SAFER as a predictive tool), not merely asserted.

## Provenance and limitations

Direct PDF fetch of the Elsevier article was not available in this authoring session. The study design, sample size (n=67), masked methodology, and all numeric results (sensitivity, specificity, odds ratios) are reported from indexed search summaries and the PubMed record. The C-BARQ reference is the Serpell et al. validated instrument; the Bollen & Horowitz study used C-BARQ as the ground-truth comparator for SAFER and mAAP validation.

The ASPCA's own later position statement on shelter dog behavior assessments acknowledges that "behavior assessments have not proven highly accurate or precise when used to predict aggression after adoption" — this study is the empirical anchor for that institutional admission.
