# Mech 1970 — *The Wolf* and the alpha-wolf claim (SIDE B: the superseded popular claim)

## Summary

L. David Mech's 1970 book ***The Wolf: The Ecology and Behavior of an Endangered
Species*** popularized the **alpha-wolf** framing: that a wolf pack is a
strength-based dominance hierarchy topped by an "alpha" pair that won its position
through contest. This framing was carried into decades of dog-training advice.
Mech himself later disavowed it. This note captures **SIDE B** of the
`alpha_wolf_dominance` Cat 3 pair — the superseded popular claim — as documented
by **Mech's own website**, `davemech.org` (tier `other`, an author self-statement,
not a peer-reviewed primary).

The opposing, higher-trust pole is **SIDE A**
(`mech-1999-alpha-status-correction.md`), Mech's 1999 peer-reviewed paper, which
both **contradicts** and **supersedes** this 1970 claim. Those two binding edges
are declared on Side A and point into `pub_mech_1970_the_wolf` declared here.

## What the source reported (verified verbatim)

From `davemech.org`, the `expected_source` substring for this side:

> "One of the outdated pieces of information is the concept of the alpha wolf."

The statement also notes the book was "written in 1968, published in 1970" and
remained "in print until 2022," and that "Although most of the book's info is
still accurate, much is outdated." On why the alpha concept is now considered
outdated, the page explains that "alpha" implies "competing with others and
becoming top dog by winning a contest or battle," whereas "most wolves who lead
packs achieved their position simply by mating and producing pups"; today
scientists prefer "breeding male," "breeding female," or "adult male/female."

## Why this fits the corpus

- **Cat 3 (contradiction).** This is the superseded pole of a same-author
  self-contradiction. The 1970 book asserts a contest-won dominance hierarchy;
  Side A (1999) asserts the incompatible family-with-breeding-parents model. The
  `contradicts` edge `pub_mech_1999_alpha_status → pub_mech_1970_the_wolf` lives on
  Side A.
- **Cat 6 (temporal).** The `supersedes` edge (also on Side A) makes the 1970 book
  the older, replaced publication in the chain.

## Honest scope note

This side is documented by the author's own website, **tier `other`** (a
self-statement / tertiary-style source), not a peer-reviewed primary. The 1970
book itself is the original publication; `davemech.org` is the accessible
record that confirms, in the author's voice, what the book claimed and that he
now regards the alpha-wolf concept as outdated. Which side is "correct" is a human
ruling at ingestion and is deliberately not adjudicated here — though Mech's own
later retraction is captured faithfully so the contradiction is legible.

## Entity reuse

`person_l_david_mech`, `concept_alpha_wolf`, and `concept_dominance_theory` are
**reused** ids from the existing good-dog-corpus notes; this note does not create
parallel nodes for them. `pub_mech_1970_the_wolf` and
`pub_mech_davemech_wolf_news` are introduced here. Side A references
`pub_mech_1970_the_wolf` for the cross-note contradicts/supersedes binding.

## Provenance and verification

The `davemech.org` page was fetched directly in this authoring session and the
`expected_source` substring "One of the outdated pieces of information is the
concept of the alpha wolf" was confirmed verbatim, along with the surrounding
context about the 1970 book and the breeding-pair reframing.
