# FCI vs AKC vs The Kennel Club: Structural Comparison

## Summary

Three major registry systems dominate the global purebred dog world: the **Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI)**, the **American Kennel Club (AKC)**, and **The Kennel Club (UK)** — recently rebranded as the **Royal Kennel Club** in some contexts. Understanding their structural differences is foundational to interpreting breed standards, breed group classifications, and why the same breed can have different official classifications and requirements depending on which registry issues the standard.

## FCI: The International Coordinator

The **Fédération Cynologique Internationale** is the largest international federation of national kennel clubs, with 98 member and contract partner organizations (one per country). It was founded in 1911 by clubs from Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, and the Netherlands.

**Key structural facts about FCI:**

- **Not a registry.** FCI does not issue pedigrees or maintain breeder records. That function belongs to each national club.
- **Breed "ownership."** Each recognized breed is assigned as the "property" of a specific country. That country writes the breed standard in partnership with FCI's Standards and Scientific Commissions. FCI publishes and translates standards into English, French, German, and Spanish.
- **10-group taxonomy.** FCI divides its 356 recognized breeds into 10 groups (vs. 7 for AKC and KC).
- **Judges and shows.** FCI maintains the qualification standards for judges at FCI international shows. National clubs issue judge licenses under FCI oversight.

**FCI's relationship to AKC and KC:** Both AKC and The Kennel Club are **not FCI members** — they are independent registries that have instead signed **Letters of Agreement** with FCI for mutual pedigree and judge recognition. AKC's agreement dates from November 5, 2005; The Kennel Club's from May 1, 2017. The **United Kennel Club (UKC) has no such agreement with FCI** — this is a documented asymmetry.

## AKC: The U.S. Standard-Bearer

The **American Kennel Club** is the oldest and largest U.S. breed registry, founded 1884. It maintains the official stud book for approximately 200 recognized breeds and publishes breed standards for each.

**Key structural facts about AKC:**

- **Closed stud book.** AKC requires documented ancestry (both parents registered) for litter registration. It maintains a policy of not registering dogs from registries it does not recognize.
- **7-group taxonomy.** AKC organizes breeds into Sporting, Hound, Working, Terrier, Toy, Non-Sporting, and Herding (added 1983).
- **CHIC program.** The Canine Health Information Center (CHIC) is a recommended screening database, not a requirement — AKC does not mandate health testing for breeding stock. (This contrasts with FCI-member national clubs that often require breed-specific health screening as a condition of registration.)
- **Parent club system.** Each AKC-recognized breed has a parent breed club that advises on the standard and breeding recommendations.

**AKC breed group for German Shepherd Dog: Herding Group** — distinct from the Pastoral Group classification assigned by The Kennel Club for the same breed.

## The Kennel Club (UK): The Original Registry

**The Kennel Club** (now trading as Royal Kennel Club in the UK) was founded in 1873 and is the oldest kennel club in the world.

**Key structural facts about The Kennel Club:**

- **Closed stud book.** Similar to AKC, Kennel Club registration requires registered ancestry.
- **7-group taxonomy** (same structure as AKC: Gundog, Hound, Pastoral, Terrier, Toy, Utility, Working — terminology differs slightly from AKC).
- **BVA/KC health schemes.** The Kennel Club co-administers hip and elbow dysplasia screening schemes with the British Veterinary Association. Breed-specific health requirements are more prescriptive than AKC's guidelines — the KC's Assured Breeders scheme mandates specific tests for specific breeds.

**Kennel Club breed group for German Shepherd Dog: Pastoral Group** — different from AKC's Herding Group for the same breed. This is a cross-registry classification difference available as a Cat 3 seed.

## The Closed vs. Open Registry Debate

This comparison note seeds a Cat 3 (contradiction) pair between two concepts: **closed stud book** and **open registry**.

**The closed registry position** (dominant in AKC, KC, FCI-member clubs): A closed stud book maintains breed type and genetic integrity. It ensures that show dogs conform to established standards. It creates a traceable pedigree record for every registered dog.

**The open registry position** (advocated by canine geneticists, organizations like GDC — Genetic Disease Control in Animals, and working-dog registries): Closed stud books cause inbreeding depression. Starting with small founder populations and never adding outside blood causes progressive accumulation of harmful recessive alleles. The Swedish open registry, begun in the 1970s, reportedly reduced hip dysplasia incidence by 50% over 13 years in Swedish breeding stock. The OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) certifies only disease-free animals — keeping affected animals' status secret — whereas open registries publish all test results including carriers.

Both positions have credentialed professional advocates. This is a genuine contradiction in breeding philosophy, not a factual error on either side.
