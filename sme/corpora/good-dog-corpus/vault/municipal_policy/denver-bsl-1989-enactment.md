# Denver Revised Municipal Code Sec. 8-55 — pit bull ban enacted (1989)

## Summary

On the night of **July 31–August 1, 1989**, the Denver City Council adopted **Bill No. 434, Series of 1989**, enacting **Denver Revised Municipal Code Sec. 8-55 ("Pit bulls prohibited")** by a vote of **9 Ayes, 2 Nays, and 1 Abstention**. Mayor **Federico Peña** signed the ordinance on **August 2, 1989**. The law made it unlawful for any person to own, possess, keep, exercise control over, maintain, harbor, transport, or sell any pit bull within the City and County of Denver.

This note is the originating half of the Denver BSL lifecycle. The closing half is the voter-approved **Ballot Measure 2J** passed on **November 3, 2020** (over 65% approval), which formally repealed the ban; the repeal took effect **January 1, 2025**.

## What the ordinance did

Per the Animal Legal & Historical Center's archived ordinance text, Sec. 8-55:

- **Prohibited** owning or harboring any pit bull within Denver city limits, defined as any dog that is an American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier; any dog displaying the majority of physical traits of one or more of those breeds; or any dog substantially conforming to AKC or UKC breed standards for those breeds.
- **Grandfather clause** (pre-ordinance licensed dogs): Dogs already licensed as pit bulls before the ordinance's publication date (**August 7, 1989**) could remain if their owners applied for and received an annual pit bull license by **January 1, 1990**. Grandfathered owners were required to: (1) obtain **$100,000 liability insurance**; (2) confine the dog in an **eight-foot-high fenced enclosure** posted with "PIT BULL DOG" signs; (3) **muzzle** the dog at all times when outdoors; and (4) have the dog **tattooed with a registration number**.
- **Grandfathered dogs' offspring**: Puppies of grandfathered pit bulls had to be removed from the city or surrendered to the animal shelter for destruction.
- Approximately **300 pit bulls** were registered under the grandfather clause. By 2003, all had died, closing the legal window for any pit bull to legally remain in Denver.

## Triggering incident

The ordinance was catalyzed by a **October 1986 fatal mauling** of a three-year-old boy, **Willie Billingsley**, by a pit bull in southwest Denver. A prior non-fatal pit bull attack in February 1989 of a seven-year-old girl in **Miami, Florida** (which prompted Dade County's pit bull ban) contributed to the political momentum. City Councilmembers **Ramona Martinez** and **Mary DeGroot** cited the Miami case in urging Denver to adopt a similar ban.

## Court challenge: Colorado Dog Fanciers v. Denver

Multiple parties filed consolidated lawsuits in Denver District Court in fall 1989 challenging the ordinance's constitutionality. On **June 28, 1990**, District Judge **Rothenberg** issued a written decision upholding Sec. 8-55 as a constitutional exercise of legislative authority.

Plaintiffs appealed to the **Colorado Supreme Court**. On **November 12, 1991**, the Court affirmed, finding Denver had a **rational basis** for the ban. The Court upheld the city's factual findings that pit bull characteristics — including strength, tenacity, and lack of warning signals before attacking — meant attacks had the potential to be "more severe and more likely to result in fatalities." The Court placed the burden of proof on the city (not the dog owner) to prove a disputed dog was a pit bull at any hearing, but did not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt for a regulatory (non-criminal) purpose. The portion of the ordinance limiting pit bull license applications to owners of **previously licensed** dogs was severed as lacking rational basis.

## State preemption and home rule

In **2004**, the Colorado Legislature enacted **House Bill 1279**, which prohibited municipalities from enacting breed-specific legislation. Denver, as a **home-rule city**, challenged the state's authority over municipal dog regulation. The city prevailed in that litigation, and Sec. 8-55 remained in effect as a home-rule municipal ordinance even after the state law.

## Timeline of repeal attempts

- **February 2020**: Councilman **Chris Herndon** introduced a full repeal measure. Denver City Council passed it **7–4** (Kniesch, Black, Clark, Herndon, Hinds, Sandoval, Torres in favor; Flynn, Kashmann, Ortega, Sawyer opposed). Mayor **Michael Hancock vetoed** the measure — his first and only veto in three terms — citing public safety risk. Council failed to override the veto: the override vote fell **8–5** (nine votes needed).
- **August 2020**: Herndon placed a revised repeal measure on the **November 2020 ballot** as **Ballot Measure 2J**. Denver City Council voted to send it to voters **11–1** (Ortega opposed).
- **November 3, 2020**: Denver voters approved **Ballot Measure 2J** with over **65%** approval.
- **January 1, 2025**: Repeal of Sec. 8-55 took effect. The replacement regime requires a **breed-restricted license** with conditions; dogs with no behavioral incidents within three years graduate to a standard license.

## Status

**Resolved / superseded.** The Denver BSL lifecycle (1989–2025) is now closed. Sec. 8-55 is the originating instrument; Ballot Measure 2J is the closing instrument that [supersedes] it. The 35-year gap between enactment and repeal makes this the longest-running individual-municipal BSL case in the corpus.

## Cross-references

- **Closing half of the lifecycle:** The 2020 Ballot Measure 2J supersession edge is declared in this note; a separate note covering the 2020 ballot measure and 2025 effective date can be added in v0.2 to expand the lifecycle.
