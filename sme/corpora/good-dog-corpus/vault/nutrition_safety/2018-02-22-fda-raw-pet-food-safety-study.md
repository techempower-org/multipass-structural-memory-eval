# FDA Raw Pet Food Diets Can Be Dangerous to You and Your Pet (Feb 22 2018)

## Summary

On **February 22, 2018**, the FDA published a public health factsheet titled "Get the Facts! Raw Pet Food Diets can be Dangerous to You and Your Pet" on its animal health literacy website. The publication synthesizes findings from a **two-year FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) study** conducted between **October 2010 and July 2012** that screened over 1,000 pet food samples for disease-causing bacteria. The study found that raw pet food was significantly more likely to be contaminated with **Salmonella** and **Listeria monocytogenes** than any other category of pet food tested. The factsheet explicitly recommends against feeding raw diets to pets and advises strict handling precautions for owners who choose to do so.

This publication's `subject_of` event is the 2010–2012 study itself (`event_fda_raw_food_study_2010_2012`), not the 2019 Bravo Packing recall — though the recall is mentioned as a concrete illustration.

## The FDA CVM two-year study (Oct 2010 – Jul 2012)

The study was conducted in two phases:

**Phase 1:** Approximately 1,000 samples of various pet food types were purchased from retail outlets and online and screened for Salmonella.

**Phase 2:** Expanded to 196 raw pet food samples (dog and cat food, primarily frozen and freeze-dried in tube-like packages), analyzed at six participating laboratories for both **Salmonella** and **Listeria monocytogenes**.

Key quantitative findings:

| Pet Food Type | Samples Tested | Salmonella+ | L. monocytogenes+ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Raw pet food | 196 | 15 | 32 |
| Dry exotic pet food | 190 | 0 | 0 |
| Jerky-type treats | 190 | 0 | 0 |
| Semi-moist dog food | 120 | 0 | 0 |
| Semi-moist cat food | 120 | 0 | 0 |
| Dry dog food | 120 | 0 | 0 |
| Dry cat food | 120 | 1 | 0 |

The study was the first to document **Listeria monocytogenes contamination of commercial pet food** in the United States. Dr. Renate Reimschuessel, CVM veterinarian and one of the study's principal investigators, stated that "quite a large percentage of the raw foods for pets we tested were positive for the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes."

Raw pet food contamination rates: **7.7% for Salmonella, 16.3% for L. monocytogenes** in the Phase 2 sample set.

## FDA's regulatory position on raw pet food

The factsheet articulates the FDA's position:

- **Raw pet food poses significant health risks to both pets and pet owners.** The single best thing an owner can do to prevent infection is not to feed a raw diet.
- Pet food is considered **adulterated** under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act when contaminated with Salmonella and not subject to a subsequent commercial heat step or other process that will kill the Salmonella (21 CFR 500.35).
- The agency does not currently have a formal definition of "raw pet food" but considers products where the primary protein source is uncooked animal tissue to fall within the scope of its concern.
- Contaminated pet food can serve as a **zoonotic reservoir** — infected animals can shed Salmonella and L. mono in feces, contaminating the home environment and exposing human household members without appearing ill themselves.

## The supersession chain

This note seeds a `supersedes` edge from the 2018 factsheet to `pub_fda_raw_meat_guidance_2004` (FDA Guidance for Industry #122, "Manufacture and Labeling of Raw Meat Foods for Companion and Captive Noncompanion Carnivores and Omnivores," May 2004 / revised November 2004). The 2004 guidance documented the FDA's concern about health risks from raw meat products for animals and recommended against feeding raw meat to domestic pets, but it preceded the CVM's systematic two-year dataset. The 2018 factsheet represents the FDA's updated position incorporating new quantitative evidence from the study, explicitly stating "FDA thinks that raw pet food poses significant health risks."

## The 2019 Bravo Packing / Performance Dog recall

The factsheet references — as a concrete example of ongoing risk — the 2019 recall of **Performance Dog frozen raw pet food** manufactured by **Bravo Packing Inc.** of Carneys Point, New Jersey. During a routine inspection, FDA collected two product samples:

- **Performance Dog raw pet food, lot code 072219** — positive for both **Salmonella** and **Listeria monocytogenes**
- **Bravo Packing beef raw pet food** — positive for Salmonella (not yet distributed)

The FDA issued a public health alert in **September 2019** cautioning pet owners against all Performance Dog frozen raw pet food produced on or after July 22, 2019, because the products lack lot codes on retail packaging, making complete recall impossible.

## Provenance and limitations

All quantitative claims above are sourced from the FDA factsheet (primary source URL of record), the published study (Nemser et al., *Foodborne Pathogens and Disease*, 2014; 11(5): 388–396), and the FDA Compliance Policy Guide Sec. 690.800. The factsheet's primary data source is the CVM study; the study results were first published in the peer-reviewed literature before being summarized in the factsheet.
