# AVMA Policy — Raw or Undercooked Animal-Source Protein in Cat and Dog Diets

## Summary

The American Veterinary Medical Association maintains a policy discouraging
the feeding of raw or undercooked animal-source protein to cats and dogs on
the grounds that such diets carry pathogen risk to both animals and the
humans who handle them. This is the **higher-trust (professional-body) pole**
of a Cat 3 contradiction pair on the *relative risk* of commercial raw diets.
The opposing pole is a named-author consumer-commentary review hosted at Truth
About Pet Food (`community_journalism/truth-about-pet-food-raw-review.md`,
note_id `cj_tapf_raw_review`), which argues that no confirmed human
salmonellosis has been linked to these diets and that the studies the AVMA
relies on are of mixed quality.

Which side is "correct" is a human ruling at ingestion. This note captures the
AVMA side faithfully and does not adjudicate the dispute.

## What the source states

The policy's operative sentence, quoted verbatim from the live AVMA page
(accessed 2026-06-17):

> "The AVMA discourages feeding any raw or undercooked animal-sourced
> proteins (e.g., meat, poultry, fish, egg, milk) to dogs and cats because of
> their risk to human and animal health."

On the pathogens of concern:

> "Raw or undercooked animal-sourced protein may be contaminated with a
> variety of pathogens, including *Salmonella* spp, *Campylobacter* spp,
> *Clostridium* spp, *Escherichia coli*, *Listeria monocytogenes*, highly
> pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, *Mycobacterium bovis*, and
> enterotoxigenic *Staphylococcus aureus*."

On the public-health rationale:

> "People handling contaminated raw pet foods are also at risk of becoming
> sick."

## The point of disagreement (Cat 3)

The contradiction is over **relative risk**, not over whether raw protein can
ever carry pathogens (both sides concede contamination is possible). The AVMA
treats the pathogen risk — particularly the zoonotic, handler-facing risk — as
sufficient to discourage the practice outright. The Truth About Pet Food
review counters on three fronts: (1) that *no confirmed cases of human
salmonellosis have been associated with* commercial raw diets, (2) that dry
foods are recalled at least as often, and (3) that the studies underpinning
the AVMA position are largely uncontrolled or anecdotal. The `contradicts`
edge in this note binds the two primary publications; the dissent's own
entities are declared in the side-B note.

This pair is honest about its open status: the relative-risk question is not
settled science, and the note does not imply that it is.

## Why this fits the corpus

- **Cat 3 (contradiction).** Declares an explicit `contradicts` edge from
  `pub_avma_raw_diet_policy` to `pub_tapf_raw_review_2012` (resolved
  cross-note via the side-B note's id). The edge is flagged
  `needs_grounding: true` per `ontology.yaml#contradicts`
  (`requires_human_grounding: true`).
- **Entity reuse.** `org_us_fda`, `concept_raw_pet_food_safety`,
  `concept_salmonella_petfood`, and `concept_listeria_petfood` are reused
  from `nutrition_safety/2018-02-22-fda-raw-pet-food-safety-study.md` rather
  than redeclared, per maintainer guidance.

## Provenance and limitations

The manifest's proposed `expected_source` substring — "The AVMA discourages
the feeding to cats and dogs of any animal-source protein that has not first
been subjected to a process to eliminate pathogens" — **does not appear
verbatim** on the live AVMA page (WebFetch, 2026-06-17). The page's current
wording is the verbatim quote reproduced above. The substring actually used as
this note's stable grep target is therefore
`The AVMA discourages feeding any raw or undercooked animal-sourced proteins`,
which is present verbatim. AVMA policy pages are periodically re-edited and
re-dated; re-confirm against the live page at any future ingestion.
