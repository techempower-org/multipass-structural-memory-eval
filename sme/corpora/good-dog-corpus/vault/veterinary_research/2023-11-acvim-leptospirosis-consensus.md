# ACVIM consensus statement on leptospirosis in dogs (Sykes et al., JVIM 2023)

## Summary

A peer-reviewed consensus statement published in the *Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine* (volume 36, issue 6, November 2023) by Jane E. Sykes and colleagues under the auspices of the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM). The statement addresses diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control of canine leptospirosis, and represents the most current comprehensive guidance from a specialty college on the disease.

Two load-bearing positions in the statement are relevant to the corpus's Cat 3 (contradiction) and Cat 4 (alias/ingestion integrity) objectives:

1. **Universal annual vaccination recommendation.** The statement recommends that all dogs in North America — regardless of breed, age, sex, lifestyle, or geographic location — receive annual leptospirosis vaccination with a 4-serovar vaccine. This is a marked shift from earlier guidance that was breed- and lifestyle-specific.

2. **Modern leptospirosis vaccines have safety profiles comparable to other canine vaccines.** The statement directly addresses the historical concern about elevated adverse reaction rates, especially in small-breed dogs, finding that contemporary data do not support this concern at a statistically significant level.

This note is the anchor for the corpus's second Cat 3 contradiction pair, `lepto_vaccine_adverse_reactions_2023`, which pairs the 2023 consensus position against prior guidance that recommended caution in small breeds.

## Key recommendations

On universal vaccination:
> "Vaccines should be administered annually to all dogs starting at 12 weeks of age, regardless of breed, because leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, can be severe or fatal despite treatment, and exposure can occur regardless of age, geography, or lifestyle."

On vaccine safety and adverse reactions:
> "Based on available information, adverse reactions to leptospiral vaccines seem to be rare, with <53 adverse events per 10,000 doses. Most adverse reactions are minor, and serious anaphylactic reactions were reported no more often for dogs given leptospiral vaccines than for other vaccine antigens."

> "Patient factors such as breed and size can influence the risk of vaccine-associated adverse events, regardless of the antigen source. Research approximately 2 decades ago indicated that some vaccines for dogs that included a Leptospira component contained high concentrations of bovine serum albumin, which could account for post-vaccinal IgE-based adverse events. More recent research indicates protein content, concentrations, and severe adverse event rates are not higher for leptospirosis vaccines than distemper-parvovirus or rabies vaccines."

On vaccine efficacy:
- Current 4-serovar bacterin vaccines provide at least 12 months of duration of immunity.
- Protection against clinical disease: ~84% overall pooled efficacy across commercial vaccines (from systematic review and meta-analysis cited in the statement).
- Protection against renal carrier state: ~88%.
- Vaccines are serogroup-specific; partial cross-protection to heterologous serogroups has been documented.
- Leptospirosis in fully vaccinated dogs has been documented but appears uncommon.

## The Cat 3 contradiction pair

The 2023 ACVIM consensus directly reverses the pre-2020 normative position that:
- Leptospirosis vaccination was recommended primarily for large-breed dogs with rural outdoor exposure.
- Small-breed dogs were frequently unvaccinated due to concerns about adverse reactions.
- Vaccination every 6 months was sometimes recommended for high-risk dogs.

The contradiction pair `lepto_vaccine_adverse_reactions_2023` pairs this 2023 consensus statement (universal annual vaccination for all dogs, modern vaccines have equivalent safety to other vaccines) against the prior consensus (selective vaccination based on breed/lifestyle, historical concern about elevated reaction rates in small dogs).
