# v0.1 Corpus Authoring Contract

**Purpose:** Define exactly what goes into the starter corpus so that the benchmark pipeline can be validated end-to-end before scaling to v1.0.

**Principle:** Hand-author everything. No LLM synthesis, no dataset adaptation. At 30 notes this is 2-3 hours of writing. The payoff is that every ground-truth answer is verified and every defect is intentional.

**Starting point:** [`questions.yaml`](questions.yaml) ships nine reference questions covering the multi-hop chain A, the temporal evolution chain, one contradiction pair, and one alias pair from the schema below. Use it as a working template, then expand to the full 50-question set described in this document as you author the corresponding vault notes.

## Ground truth questions: 50 total

### Multi-hop chains (10 queries, annotated with ground-truth hop depth)

| # | Query | Answer | min_hops | Chain |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | "What auth system is Kai working on?" | OAuth token refresh | 1 | Direct |
| H2 | "What is the OAuth token refresh spec about?" | [spec content] | 1 | Direct |
| H3 | "What system does the alerting integrate with for SSO?" | OAuth | 1 | Direct |
| H4 | "Who debugged the system that blocked the Driftwood migration?" | Kai | 2 | Kai→OAuth→Driftwood |
| H5 | "What monitoring system connects to the auth infrastructure?" | Alerting→OAuth | 2 | monitoring→alerting→OAuth |
| H6 | "What project uses the token system debugged by Kai?" | Driftwood | 2 | Kai→OAuth→Driftwood |
| H7 | "Which deployment blocked by the same token issue that the alerting SSO depends on?" | Driftwood | 2 | alerting→OAuth→Driftwood |
| H8 | "What project was affected by the issue debugged by someone on the infrastructure team?" | Driftwood | 3 | team→Kai→OAuth→Driftwood |
| H9 | "What monitoring connects to the auth system debugged by a member of the infrastructure team?" | alerting→OAuth←Kai←team | 3 | team→Kai→OAuth←alerting |
| H10 | "Which team member's debugging work relates to the system used for deployment SSO?" | Kai (OAuth used by alerting for SSO) | 3 | team→Kai→OAuth→alerting |

### Category-specific queries (40 queries, ~8 per category)

**Cat 1 — Factual retrieval (8):** Direct fact questions with single ground-truth answers. "When did the team decide to use Clerk?" "What issue did Kai debug?"

**Cat 2b — Canonicalization (6):** Queries that require alias resolution. "What privacy technology is used in identity verification?" (must surface both ZK proof and zero-knowledge cryptography). "What container orchestration tool is deployed?" (must surface both k8s and Kubernetes).

**Cat 3 — Contradiction (4):** "What auth system are we using?" (should flag Clerk vs Auth0). "What database are we using?" (should surface PostgreSQL with evolution chain or flag SQLite contradiction).

**Cat 4 — Ingestion integrity (4):** These don't have "queries" in the traditional sense — they test whether the system or SME detects the injected defects. Scored by defect detection rate, not QA accuracy.

**Cat 5 — Gap detection (4):** "What topics span auth_engineering and privacy_research?" (should surface token-based identity gap). "What areas have no cross-references?" Scored at L1/L2/L3.

**Cat 6 — Temporal (6):** "What database are we using?" (current: PostgreSQL). "What database were we using in session 25?" (SQLite). "When did our database choice change?" (full evolution chain). "What was the most recent auth decision?" (Auth0, superseding Clerk).

**Cat 7 — Token efficiency (8):** Same queries as Cat 1 and multi-hop, but scored for tokens-per-correct-answer across Conditions A and B.

**Cat 8 — Ontology coherence (0 explicit queries):** Scored from graph snapshot analysis, not from queries. The corpus's entity type and edge type distributions provide the ground truth.

## Calibration thresholds

| Property | Threshold | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Gap disconnection | Shortest path auth_engineering↔privacy_research > 4 hops | No accidental bridges |
| Alias string similarity | Max Jaccard < 0.25 | Confirms testing canonicalization |
| Alias semantic similarity | Min cosine > 0.78 (nomic-embed-text) | Confirms aliases are semantically close |
| Runaway cluster | Ghost entities in own connected component | Not bridged to main graph |
| Monoculture batch | Betti-0 divergence > 2.0 (typed vs RELATED subgraphs) | Detectable split |
| Contradiction placement | Clerk and Auth0 notes in different retrieval neighborhoods | Cosine similarity of their chunks < 0.6 |

## Held-out split

v0.1 is entirely dev. No held-out portion.

v1.0 will split into:
- `corpus_dev.yaml` — for tuning (in repo)
- `corpus_heldout.yaml` — for reporting (separate download, hash-locked, not in main repo)

---

## Domain coverage limitations

v0.1 is tech/dev focused: auth, infrastructure, privacy, deployment. This biases toward systems built for developer knowledge.

v1.0 must add:
- Personal knowledge domain (health, relationships, daily routines)
- Creative domain (writing projects, research notes)
- Professional domain (meetings, decisions, org structure)

This is a known limitation, stated in the benchmark report for any v0.1 results.
