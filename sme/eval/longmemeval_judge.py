"""LongMemEval GPT-4o judge wrapper.

Re-implements the question-type-specific grading prompts from LongMemEval
upstream (`src/evaluation/evaluate_qa.py` in xiaowu0162/LongMemEval, MIT)
in a form that's callable from SME's cross-validation harness without
spawning an upstream subprocess.

Public surface:

- `grade_answer(question_type, ...)` — single judge call; returns a dict
  with `autoeval_label` in {CORRECT, PARTIAL, INCORRECT, ABSTAIN, ERROR}.
- `grade_answer_replicated(question_type, ..., replicates=K)` — K-replicate
  judge calls with majority-vote aggregation, used to characterize
  intra-rater stochasticity (see upstream issue #22).

Design notes:

- Prompts mirror the upstream methodology described in arXiv 2410.10813
  §4 ("LLM-Judge Evaluation") and the `evaluate_qa.py` source. They are
  paraphrased rather than copied verbatim — primary-source verification
  was not available in this session, so the prompts here aim for the
  *same scoring intent* (factual / synthesis / current-value / temporal
  / abstention) rather than identical wording. See the ``Open questions``
  section in ``docs/related_work/longmemeval.md``.
- The wrapper uses the ``openai`` SDK if installed; otherwise it falls
  back to a stdlib HTTP POST against the public OpenAI Chat Completions
  endpoint. Tests mock the call entirely, so neither path needs to be
  reachable in CI.
- All failure modes return ``autoeval_label='ERROR'`` rather than
  raising, so the harness can keep running across a 500-question batch
  even when individual judge calls misbehave.
