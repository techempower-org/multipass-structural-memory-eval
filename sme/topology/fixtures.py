"""Ground-truth synthetic graphs for Cat 5 (The Missing Room) and
other topology-layer tests.

Adapter-agnostic: fixtures return ``(entities, edges, ground_truth)``
tuples using the core ``Entity``/``Edge`` dataclasses, so they can be
fed to any scorer that accepts a graph snapshot.

The ground-truth dict states what the graph *is*, so scorer output
can be compared against a known answer rather than asserted about
itself.

    Entities are deliberately seeded with duplicates the extractor
    would have to canonicalize:

      - "Docker" + "docker" + "  Docker  " + "DOCKER"
        → four distinct IDs that all canonicalize to the same key
