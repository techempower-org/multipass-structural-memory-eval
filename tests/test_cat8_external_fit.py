"""Tests for Cat 8 sub-check 8f: external-standard ontology fit + audit.

Covers the four cases the draft calls out: a clean mappable alignment,
an under-specified (one corpus term -> several standard terms) case, an
idiosyncratic/unaligned case, and confidence-gating (a low-confidence
mapping's failure must be informational, not a violation).
