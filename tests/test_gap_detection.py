"""Correctness tests for Cat 5 (The Missing Room).

Every assertion traces back to a field in the fixture's
``ground_truth`` dict — when a test fails, the reading the scorer
produced for that field is suspect, not the fixture.

Ripser is an optional dependency (``[topology]`` extra). Tests that
need it are marked so pytest skips them cleanly when it isn't
installed; the structural-signal tests (components, bridges,
isolates, candidate gaps) run either way.
